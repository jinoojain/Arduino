Arduino Cockroach Modeling Project
=======

Objective:
Design a robot that uses the mechanics modeled from a cockroch to efficiently flip over when it has been capsized. 

Current goal:
Use a RoboXplorer (by SmartLAB) to build an initial "cockroach" that has the same basic functionalities as a cockroach.
